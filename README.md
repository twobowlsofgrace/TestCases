Testing for Web Application built using Django's Frame work

Types of Testing to be done
1) Unit Testing
2) Integrative Testing

Unit Testing
- Using Django's Test Client, in particular django.test (Test Cases)
- Allows testing of modules (Forms, Viws etc)
- Should cover all basics of test cases (Testing of Boundary Values, Equivalance Classes etc.)
- Should not change unless Requirements change

Integrative Testing
- Either using Djnago's Web Test or Selenium (TBH)
- Both have their own benefits
